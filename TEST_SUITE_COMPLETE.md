## Next Steps

### For Developers

1. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Review Coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

3. **Implement Components**
   - Use test files as specification
   - Follow test expectations for props/events
   - Add ARIA attributes as tested
   - Support dark mode and responsive design

4. **Add Components**
   - Create new test file
   - Import from test-utils.mjs
   - Follow established patterns
   - At least 10 tests per component

### For CI/CD

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run tests
  run: npm test

- name: Check coverage
  run: npm run test:coverage

- name: Upload coverage
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
```

### For QA/Testing

- Use [TESTING_GUIDE.md](src/components/shared/__tests__/TESTING_GUIDE.md) for test execution
- Review [COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md](src/components/shared/__tests__/COVERAGE_SUMMARY.md) for coverage details
- Check [README.md](src/components/shared/__tests__/README.md) for test patterns
